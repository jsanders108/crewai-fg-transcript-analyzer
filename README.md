# CrewAI Focus Group Transcript Analyzer

## Project Objective

I developed this project to demonstrate the power of the CrewAI framework in assisting market researchers with challenging tasks such as summarizing and analyzing focus group transcripts. By leveraging multiple AI agents working in concert, I showcase how complex analytical tasks can be completed quickly and efficiently.

The primary goals of this project are:

1. To automate the process of summarizing focus group transcripts
2. To perform in-depth analysis of the summarized content
3. To generate a comprehensive report with actionable insights

By achieving these objectives, I illustrate how CrewAI can significantly enhance the productivity and effectiveness of market research processes.

## Focus Group Background

For this project, I used mock focus group data generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet based on a set of predefined objectives. These mock focus groups were designed to simulate real-world market research scenarios, specifically for the launch of a new premium product: white strawberries.

The focus group transcript is contained in the `white-strawberry-focus-group-transcript.md` file. This document simulates a detailed conversation between a moderator and eight participants, capturing their reactions and opinions about the proposed white strawberry product concepts.

### Focus Group Objectives

The mock focus groups were centered around the following key objectives:

1. Determine which of three potential product names and accompanying marketing copy resonates best with participants:
   - "Snowberry Bliss"
   - "Ivory Nectar"
   - "Pearlberry Prime"

2. Improve the "winning" selection based on participant feedback:
   - Gather specific suggestions for refining the chosen name and copy
   - Identify additional product features or benefits to emphasize
   - Explore potential modifications to better align with consumer expectations

3. Determine participants' willingness to buy the new product:
   - Assess overall interest in white strawberries as a premium offering
   - Explore price sensitivity and perceived value
   - Identify potential barriers to purchase and ways to overcome them

The mock focus group transcripts contain discussions and feedback from participants based on these objectives, simulating the kind of qualitative data that market researchers often need to analyze quickly and effectively.

## Code Walkthrough

In this project, I utilized the latest version of CrewAI, showcasing its updated features and syntax. Let's break down the key components of my implementation:

### 1. Agent Configuration (agents.yaml)

I defined the roles and responsibilities of the AI agents in the `agents.yaml` file:

```yaml
summarizer:
  role: Focus Group Transcript Condenser
  goal: Create accurate, concise, and objective summaries of focus group transcripts...

analyst:
  role: Focus Group Insights Analyst
  goal: Analyze condensed focus group transcripts in the context of research objectives...

report_writer:
  role: Focus Group Insights Report Writer
  goal: Transform analytical insights into a comprehensive, well-structured, and persuasive report...
```

I assigned each agent a specific role in the analysis process, ensuring a clear division of labor and expertise.

### 2. Task Definition (tasks.yaml)

I outlined the specific tasks for each agent to perform in the `tasks.yaml` file:

```yaml
summarize_task:
  description: Read the provided focus group transcripts and create a comprehensive summary...

analysis_task:
  description: Analyze the summary of the focus group transcripts provided by the Summarizer Agent...

report_writing_task:
  description: Using the comprehensive analysis provided by the Analyst Agent, create a polished, well-structured markdown report...
```

These task definitions guide the agents through the process of transforming raw transcript data into actionable insights.

### 3. Crew Assembly (crew.py)

The `crew.py` file is the heart of my CrewAI implementation, where I assembled the team of AI agents:

```python
@CrewBase
class FgTranscriptAnalyzerCrew():
    agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml'
    tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.OpenAIGPT35 = ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
            temperature=0)
        
        self.OpenAIGPT4o = ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-4o", 
            temperature=0)

    @agent
    def summarizer(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['summarizer'],
            tools=[read_transcript, search_transcript], 
            allow_delegation=False,
            llm=self.OpenAIGPT4o,
            verbose=True
        )

    # ... [similar methods for analyst and report_writer]

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=2,
            memory=True
        )
```

In this class, I set up the agents with their respective configurations and tools, and assembled them into a crew that works sequentially to complete the analysis.

### 4. Execution (main.py)

Finally, I created a `main.py` file to kick off the entire process:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from fg_transcript_analyzer.crew import FgTranscriptAnalyzerCrew

def run():   
    FgTranscriptAnalyzerCrew().crew().kickoff()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

This simple script creates an instance of the `FgTranscriptAnalyzerCrew` and initiates the analysis process.

## Output Showcase

The culmination of the AI agents' work is a comprehensive markdown report (`final_fg_report.md`) that provides valuable insights from the mock focus group discussion. Below is the full content of the final report:

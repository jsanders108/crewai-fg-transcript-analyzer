# Focus Group Objectives: White Strawberry Product Launch

## 1. Background

Our company has successfully developed a new premium product: white strawberries. To support the launch of this innovative fruit, we have created three potential product names, each with accompanying marketing copy. As a premium offering, these white strawberries will be positioned at a higher price point than our traditional strawberry products.

The three proposed concepts are:

1. **Name: "Snowberry Bliss"**
   
   Marketing Copy: "Indulge in the unexpected delight of Snowberry Bliss. These rare white strawberries offer a smooth, sweet flavor with hints of pineapple and vanilla. Each bite is a refreshing escape from the ordinary, perfect for adding a touch of elegance to desserts or enjoying as a unique snack. Experience the magic of nature's pale beauty with Snowberry Bliss."

2. **Name: "Ivory Nectar"**
   
   Marketing Copy: "Discover the treasure of Ivory Nectar strawberries. Our carefully cultivated white berries boast a delicate aroma and a lusciously creamy texture. With their subtle sweetness and notes of rose, these pale gems elevate any dish from simple to sophisticated. Treat yourself to the refined taste of Ivory Nectar - where rarity meets exquisite flavor."

3. **Name: "Pearlberry Prime"**
   
   Marketing Copy: "Introducing Pearlberry Prime, the crown jewel of strawberries. These lustrous white berries aren't just a feast for the eyes; they offer a complex flavor profile that dances between sweet and tropical. Prized for their unique appearance and delightful taste, Pearlberry Prime strawberries are the perfect way to add a touch of luxury to your table. Savor the distinction of nature's finest."

## 2. Objectives

b) **Improve the "winning" selection based on participant feedback:**
   - Gather specific suggestions for refining the chosen name and copy
   - Identify any additional product features or benefits that should be emphasized
   - Explore potential modifications to better align with consumer expectations

c) **Determine participants' willingness to buy the new product:**
   - Assess overall interest in white strawberries as a premium offering
   - Explore price sensitivity and perceived value
   - Identify potential barriers to purchase and ways to overcome them

## 3. Next Steps

Following the completion of the focus groups:

a) **Select a winning concept:**
   - Analyze focus group data to identify the most promising name and marketing approach
   - Incorporate participant feedback to refine and strengthen the chosen concept

b) **Develop a full-fledged marketing campaign:**
   - Create a comprehensive marketing strategy based on the winning concept
   - Design supporting materials (e.g., packaging, promotional items, advertising content)

By achieving these objectives, we aim to launch our white strawberry product with a compelling identity and marketing approach that resonates with consumers and positions us for success in the premium fruit market.
